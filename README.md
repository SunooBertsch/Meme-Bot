## Telegram Bot: residual-bot

A customizable auto-response bot that allows administrators to create guided interactions with an automated bot via the Telegram desktop and mobile app.

This application utilizes the Telegraf client library and interacts with the Telegram Bot API.

**KEY ACHIEVEMENTS**

Worked closely with client and users to create succinct, helpful responses to commonly asked questions.

Utilized the Telegraf client library, creating an application that is easy to revise and edit. This allows for completely new interactions to be added or removed with minimal downtime.

Created a custom Telegram keyboard with predeterined responses to speed up interaction with the Telegram Bot.
